"""
Constants package.

This package centralizes all the application's fixed, non-configurable values
to ensure consistency, improve readability, and ease maintenance. Instead of
using 'magic numbers' or 'magic strings' directly in the code, they are
defined here and imported where needed.

Modules:
    - api: Constants related to external APIs, such as endpoint paths.
    - cache: Constants for caching, including key prefixes and TTLs.
    - network: Constants for network operations, such as timeouts.
